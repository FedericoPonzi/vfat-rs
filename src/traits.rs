//! Traits that the user must implement.
//!
//! The OS should provide:
//! * An implementation for the `TimeManagerTrait`. This is used for timestamping file creation and update.
//! * An implementation for the `BlockDevice` trait. This is used to interact with the disk.
//! * Alloc support. It is mostly used to allocate some vec and strings, it might be put behind a feature flag later on.
